## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject contributions (issues, comments, commits, code, wiki edits, etc.) that do not align with this Code of Conduct.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces — including GitHub issues, pull requests, discussions, and any other community interactions — as well as when representing the project in public spaces.

---

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by opening an issue on the repository or by contacting a project maintainer directly through GitHub.

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly. Maintainers are obligated to respect the privacy and safety of reporters.
